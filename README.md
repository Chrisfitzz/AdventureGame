# Adventure Game (Java OOP Project)

This project is a console-based adventure game built to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java.

##  Concepts involved

- Abstract classes (`Character`)
- Inheritance (`Wizard`, `Warrior`, `Archer`)
- Interfaces (`GameRules`, `SpecialAbility`)
- Enums (`CharacterType`)
- Polymorphism (array of `Character`)
- Static members and counters
- Encapsulation and method overriding
- Utility classes with static methods

##  How It Works

- Characters are created with unique IDs.
- Each character type has its own attack behavior.
- Special abilities are implemented through an interface.
- Level bonuses are applied based on character level.
- Characters can retire from battle.
- The game prints a party summary and total character count.

##  What I Learned

This project helped reinforce:

- How abstraction and inheritance work together
- How interfaces allow flexible behavior
- How polymorphism enables treating different subclasses uniformly
- The importance of clean separation of responsibilities in class design

##  Future Improvements

- Add combat system between characters
- Implement health reduction and battle mechanics
- Add user input for interactive gameplay
- Expand character types and abilities
